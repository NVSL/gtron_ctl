When Bugs Occur
===============

If something goes wrong or breaks, please file a bug report for the gtron_devel
`repo on git hub <http://example.com/>`_, and assign the bug to user :code:`stevenjswanson`.

To encourage people to start submitting bug reports, I'll only fix stuff you
submit bug reports about.  Make sure it contains a thorough description of the
problem and attach your :code:`workspace.json` and :code:`workspace.local.json`
files as well.
